## Introduction
This repository captures my growth as I explore Machine Learning topics, experiment with algorithms, and work on real-world projects. Each section reflects my understanding and progress as I tackle different ML concepts.

## Why This Journey?
Machine Learning is transforming the way we solve problems, and I aim to develop a strong foundation in this field. My approach is to balance theory with practical implementation, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with anyone interested in learning along the way.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Linear Regression
A fundamental algorithm for predicting numerical values. I'll explore the basics of fitting lines to data using cost functions and optimization techniques like gradient descent.

### 2. Logistic Regression
A popular method for binary classification problems. This section will cover how we can model probabilities and apply logistic regression to datasets with categorical outcomes.

### 3. Naive Bayes
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. I'll explore how Naive Bayes handles different types of data (Gaussian, Multinomial) and its application in text classification tasks like spam detection.

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A simple yet effective algorithm for classification and regression. I'll cover how KNN works by finding the "k" closest data points and how it can be applied to problems like image recognition or recommendation systems.
